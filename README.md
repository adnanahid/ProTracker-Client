# Asset Management System (AMS)

Welcome to **XYZ's Asset Management System (AMS)**!  
AMS is a comprehensive web application designed to help businesses efficiently manage their assets and products. With a focus on simplicity and usability, AMS allows HR managers to track the usage and lifecycle of company assets, ensuring smooth operations and accountability.

## Key Features

    2. **User Management**: Robust user management system to allow HR managers to assign, track, and retrieve assets from employees with ease.

    3. **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor asset usage and availability in real-time, ensuring accountability and efficient utilization of resources.

    4. **Intuitive Dashboard**: A user-friendly dashboard with key metrics, including total assets, assets in use, and overdue returns.

    5. **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensure security and privacy by assigning different roles (e.g., HR Manager, Employee) with appropriate permissions.

    6. **Subscription Management**: Businesses can purchase and manage their subscription plans directly within the application.

    7. **Asset History & Reporting**: View detailed history logs of all assigned and returned assets and generate reports for audits and decision-making.

    8. **Alerts & Notifications**: Stay updated with email or in-app notifications for overdue asset returns or low stock of non-returnable items.

    9. **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Access AMS on any device with a fully responsive interface, optimized for desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

    10. **Secure Data Management**: Built with industry-standard security practices to protect sensitive asset data and user information.
